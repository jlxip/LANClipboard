<br><br>

### Start the client
Go to 'Receive' tab, click Update (it is not necessary if you have just started the program) and double-click the IP you want to connect to. That easy, there is no need to write it. Once done that, the server's clipboard shall be copied to the client's.<br>

## EXTRA OPTIONS
### Protect with a password
You can protect the server with a password, this way you will make sure than no one will have access to the data but you.
It can be done just selecting this checkbox:<br>

Thus, when a client tries to connect, this window shall appear:<br>
![Incorrect password](http://i.imgur.com/Ni0X2Cm.gif)<br>
The password is sent to the server, and checked there. This way, it should be safe enough.<br>
But **watch out**, in order to copy documents from one computer to another, a copy is stored in the client's temporal directory (_%temp%_, in Windows); so make sure to delete it whether your file contains sensitive information.
